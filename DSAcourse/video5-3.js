//with the above function we can find the info that our ram can hold dependenging on if it is 64 bit 32 bit or any other bit specification.
// If we try to pass in really large numbers then our ram can't store that much of info because of it's bit size can't store it, so it will show value as "inifinity"
// through this we will also get the idea that RAM is a temporary storage device which loss data when we switch off the system
